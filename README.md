# Snappet

For faster development this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/) with Typescript included.
I didn't know how to make a design, so I used [Material-UI](https://mui.com/) to make it easier for organize how it looks.

## Available Scripts
